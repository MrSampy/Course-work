# Map Generator system

## Concept Idea

This system allows you to create a procedurally generated map of heights, heat and humidity. This can be useful for making games of RoguelIke, RTS, Survival or RPG genres, or for playing D&D;

## Architecture

This project was created with classic layered architecture. Map Generator MS contains two logical layers: UI Level (Razor
Pages) and Business Logic layer (ASP.NET MVC Web APP & REST API).
